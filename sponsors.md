## The Sponsor's Wall of Thanks

<p>Although OpenTechSchool is run by volunteers we need a few things to do our job that usually involves money or need certain infrastructure. We are thankful to the sponsors below for supporting us in our work.
    </p>

<div class="sponsor_list">
	{% for sponsor_data in page.sponsors %}
		{% assign sponsor_id = sponsor_data[0] %}
		{% assign sponsor = sponsor_data[1] %}
		<div class="{% cycle 'left', 'right' %}">
		    {% if sponsor.logo %}
				<a href="{{sponsor.web}}"><img src="{{sponsor.logo}}" alt="{{sponsor.name}} Logo" ></a>
		    {% endif %}

			<div>
			<h3 id="{{sponsor_id}}"><a href="{{sponsor.web}}">{{sponsor.name}}</a></h3>
