So, you like what we do at OpenTechSchool, the [values](/about.html#core_values) we focus on and **you want to support us**. That is great; as we are now an official legal entity, you can simply contribute us a donation via paypal using the following button:


<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">
	<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick" />
	<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="DWWZRJAN8C9DE" />
	<input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!" />
	<img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/de_DE/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" />
</form>

Thank you very much. Your support is highly appreciated.

## What you get
Oh. So you want something for that support in exchange? Well, as said before, we have a few [values](/about.html#core_values) that we look after and that are very valuable to us. But depending on your support, we might be very thankful and do some of the following. But to be clear, we cannot make any promise for any particular compensations - especially those that go beyond what is stated here.

### Supporting a specific Event
If you sponsor a specific event, workshop, series or program, we are willing to offer the following:


 * Make you an official supporter on the corresponding local meetup.com group (for up to one month after the event is over)
 * Name you as a supporter on all official promotion and marketing around and for that event (namely: tweets, facebook, meetup event and blog post)
 * You are free to provide us the logo / branding for us to include in promotion material
 * You are free to send up to two people to the event and officially represent you/your entity there, mingle and talk to people (as long as it doesn't disturb event participation) - there won't be any public speaking time though
 * If you want to take pictures or videos, make sure it gets stated before at the event and if there is someone, who doesn't want to be included in your material, you have to respect that
 * You are free to say that you supported this event of OpenTechSchool and link to the website or the event itself



### Support in general and on infrastructure
If you want to support us more generally and globally or by providing infrastructure and services that not only one specific event will benefit from but OpenTechSchool as a whole, it wouldn't make much sense to name you at all events but we'd like to thank you none-the less by:
 
 * Adding you to the [official list of sponsors](/sponsors.html)
 * Writing a Blog post about your contribution, in which you can optionally describe your service infrastructure
 * Promote that Blog post like any other
 * A second round of thanks via social media
 * You are free to name yourself an official Supporter of OpenTechSchool


### What won't happen

There is often a wrong assumption on what one can expect for supporting us. Let us be clear: **It is more important to us to provide the best learning experience in a safe learning environment, than garnering conditional support, and we have no problem declining such, if we believe it would have a negative impact on those and our values**. That said, here are a few things you can be sure, won't happen because of your support:

 * we will not send emails to our community on your request,
 * we will not change the name of any event, include your brand in it or temper with the learning material to make it a fit for you
 * you do not have the right to review any material before it gets published
 * your support will not annul our [promotion guidelines](/handbooks/promotion.html) for your event and what you do
 * you do not have the right to call it "yours", not that workshop, programme or OpenTechSchool in general 
 * You must not use any photos or videos take as part of your public marketing campaign
