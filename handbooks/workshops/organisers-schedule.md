So you decided to lead your first Workshop. Either re-run one already existing or [one that was newly created](/handbooks/workshops/starting-a-workshop.html), you got the coaches, a time and a venue, everything is ready to get down, but how do you do that?

In order to make the Workshop the most accessible and best experience for everyone, here are a few things you might wanna do. As usual this is just a rough guideline from our experience, feel free to skip anything or only pick parts you consider useful for your workshop.


## 2+ Weeks before: start promotion

In our experience, you should schedule the meetup event at least two weeks in advance to have some time to promote your workshop and make people aware it is going to happen. If you actually have more than 3 weeks that is amazing, but don't schedule it for a half a year in advance (unless there is a good reason for that) because people will forget they signed up and the turn-up number will be lower.

When scheduling the meetup event, please keep in mind:
 * we usually schedule the event info and start the promotion _before_ signups are opened. This is in order to ensure we reach as many people as possible and only those, who are able to check their emails every 2 minutes.
 * out of experience the best time to open for signups is a Tuesdays at 6pm. Start your promotion at least 24 before that.
 * set the number of people able to sign up to the number of coaches which confirmed to come * 4. So if you have 10 coaches, allow 40 signups.
 * You might want to close signups a few days before the actual event to make sure communication happens accordingly.

When promoting, also make sure potential coaches know they are invited to come and who to talk to, if they want to. Usually that would be via answering on a public email or to you personally.

## Two days before signups close
 * You might have more coaches now. Raise the number of signups accordingly. You might actually want to "overbook" your event by 25-30% (the usual drop-out-rate for free workshops).
 * Send email via the meetup form to the participants, who signed up so far, telling them there are more seats available, you are looking forward to seeing you there and to update their RSVP if they can't make it to giver others a chance to participate instead. You can find an almost [copy-paste-able example here](/handbooks/workshops/example-before-closing.html).
 * Send an email to your coaches, confirming time and place, containing with a link to the coaches guide as well as the learning material. You can find an [example here](/handbooks/workshops/example-coaches-mail.html).
 * You might want to promote the workshop once more, stating you have more open slots now.

## After Signups closed
 * Send the confirmation email to the participants through the meetup interface. Make sure it contains at least: the place and time, any requirements needed (like "bring a laptop", "install X") and how to get in touch in case they are unable to full fill those. Any more specific directions on the venue if needed and other useful material. But keep it short. [An example for you is provided here](/handbooks/workshops/example-after-closing.html).

## The Workshop itself

### Coaches meetup before
Have a quick chat with the coaches, quickly re-iterate, how this is going to work. Get familiar with the space, tell them to be welcoming and inviting when people come in. Tell them to tell the learners to get comfortable and set up their environment. Tell the coaches to be standing, while the learners arrive. That is more welcoming than sitting and working on your stuff.

### Set up the space
 - Set up tables and chairs in the room for the expected audience
 - Make sure all coaches have some kind of name badge (use post-its or write on tape)
 - You might want to set up some signs (papers with arrows) to point learners to the workspace
 - If you have requirements, learners might show up with problems before the event, make sure to have a coach on each problem, fixing it asap.
 - If you are working on a food-to-share-system set up a place for that as well, mark it appropriately.

### Kickoff the event
 - Once the majority of learners is there and set up, do a short quick welcoming speech.
 - Ask how many people know the OpenTechSchool already and/or have been to other events before (make them raise their hands. it sounds cheesy but sets an interactive mood.). If a bigger group doesn't know what OTS is and does, make a quick introduction and tell them to check the website for more details and they should check out the upcoming learners meetup.
 - Explain the schedule and how the workshop is going to happen: that they are working on their own with the material, the coaches standing around are there to assist, help and support, so instead of getting stuck, ask them. If there will be a demo session at the end, tell them about that, too.
 - Make sure you explained the necessaries, like:
  * how to get back in if you are out (if that is a problem)
  * where to find the toilets, for all genders
  * where to get something to drink, when the food will be delivered, that kinda stuff
 - Tell them to take breaks whenever they want. It is important to take breaks. We - developers - do breaks all the time.
 - Show the URL to the learners material again. Let them know, that they should work at their own pace and if they are not able to get finished that day that is fine, too, the material is available online all the time. Tell them to get started.
 - And mention, that they are very much invited to the next learners meetup to show what they've done in this workshop, find other learners, connect and socialise. It would be great if knew the date if it was announced already.

### Demo Session (optional, but encouraged)
Often learners come up with amazing and awesome little slightly-off-the-path hacks during the workshop. Either planned before hand or just because so many awesome things happened, you might want to make a small demo-session at the end inviting everyone to show their results of the day. Encourage everyone doing something creative to come to the front and show it to the others. It doesn't only give them recognition on their work but also shows the others what awesome things you can do with just a little effort (of peers on a similar knowledge level).

### Closing the event
When the first people pack their stuff or after the Demo, ask for the attention for another minute to:
 - thank everybody for coming
 - ask them to provide feedback through the "how was it"-email they'll be receiving from meetup a few days later because it helps you improve
 - invite them again to show their hacks and awesome ideas at the next Learning Meetup
 - don't forget to thank the sponsor of the venue, food and drinks, if provided
 - let them know what the rest of the days schedule is (for e.g. if you need to be out at a certain time, but they are free to stick around, or if you are going for drinks or stuff)
 - ask them to help you clean up and rearrange the tables if you need to do that
 - and eventually ask for a round of applause for the awesome group of coaches, who helped them that day.


Congratulations, you just organised a great workshop.
