Hello Learner,

we just closed the signups for the upcoming OTS Workshop NAME_OF_WORKSHOP_HERE, DATE_OF_WORKSHOP_HERE at PLACE_OF_WORKSHOP_HERE. I am just writing you to confirm time and date and give you a few last informations and instructions.

If you have not been to any OTS Workshop so far, you should know the way the works is as the follows: We, the coaches, created some learners material before hand that each learner is going to work through at their own pace on their own or as in small teams. There are always coaches around to help you out at any point. You can find the material here (if you want to take a look before):
