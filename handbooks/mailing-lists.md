##About mailing lists (aka Google groups)

Mailing lists are our chosen way to stay on top of communication in the various branches of OTS we like to be active in. That’s why we set up a number of lists as Google groups: this way, it's possible for everyone to be up-to-date, but also not get “spammed” or overwhelmed by stuff that is of less interest to them.

## Existing mailing lists

To find all lists, please go to our [Google Groups index page](https://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forumsearch).

{% include groups_list.md %}

> **Note**: Please note that some groups are not visible to you if you don't have an <span style="color: #085987;">@opentechschool.org</span> account or you have to be a member to post. Becoming a member is easy: just come by to one of our [team breakfasts](https://blog.opentechschool.org/2012/08/ots-biweekly-team-breakfasts.html) or write an email to <span style="color: #085987;">Team Tech</span>.

## Guidelines

Team Tech decided to create some conventions to make it easier to create new groups and understand their purpose. As this is an open process, we invite everyone to suggest optimizations.

Mailinglists should:

* be/stay opt in, i.e. you have to join if you want to be part of a that group.

* follow a name pattern to easily grasp their use. For example:

   * team.berlin@ots -> all people active in this city (e.g. team.stockholm, etc.)
   * team.tech, team.communications, team.blueprint -> teams with a specific focus
   * discuss.berlin, discuss.global -> replacement for opentechschool@googlegroups.com
   * coaches.python, coaches.js, coaches.math-3d -> coach mailing lists
   * public mailing-lists such as offers@ots (or later on press@ots) -> for external people to post offers/requests to the members of OTS.
These mailing-lists are for @ots members only. They will filter, curate and/or act on the emails ( for instance, by posting/pushing the interesting offers on a designated webpage or getting in touch with the journalists, etc.)
   * When the non-prefix part of the mailing-list is two words or more (e.g. math-3d, online-courses, etc.) use "-" to separate the words

* always have a comprehensible subject prefix:

   * \[OTS-Secondword\] in all cases:

      * OTS in all caps,
      * dash
      * Secondword is upper case and is the second word in the mailing-list name (or only word in the case of the public facing mailing-list) -> e.g. Berlin for team.berlin, Tech for team.tech, Python for coaches.python, Math-3d for coaches.math-3d, Offers for offers
      * If Secondword is actually several words (e.g. math-3d, online-courses, etc.) use "-" to seperate the words and lower case for all words except the first one -> \[OTS-Math-3d\], \[OTS-Online-courses\], etc.
      * Only exception is for discuss: then use \[OpenTechSchool-Berlin\], \[OpenTechSchool-Global\] etc. -> as some people might sign up and not know/remember what OTS means and to avoid confusion with team.berlin (which is \[OTS-Berlin\])

* have varying membership/posting privileges/visibility:

   * team.* :

      * membership = only \*@ots for easier management (docs get shared automatically, etc.)
      * posting = team decision whether external mails can get in or if the list is limited to members (before this decision is made, the default should be set to members and \*@ots only)
      * visibility = team decision if content should be publicly viewable (before this decision is made, default should be set to members and \*@ots only)

   * discuss.* :

      * membership = anyone  (note: this means the "Allow new users not in opentechschool.org" setting needs to be activated and "Join the Group" should be set to "Anyone" -> both can be found in Settings/New members)
      * posting = members of the group
      * visiblity = public

   * coaches.* :

      * membership = anyone  (note: this means the "Allow new users not in opentechschool.org" setting needs to be activated and "Join the Group" should be set to "Anyone" -> both can be found in Settings/New members)
      * posting = members of the group
      * visibility = public

   * public mailing lists (e.g. offers, press, etc.)

      * membership = only \*@ots
      * posting = anyone
      * visibility = only \*@ots

* all mailing lists with members who do not have @ots addresses (i.e. non-team mailing lists) should contain an email footer with:
   * How to post to this group by email
   * How to unsubscribe from this group by email

* The group's working language is decided by each team or group of coaches.   
For public mailing lists, discuss.mailing lists, and team lists (until they decide to change it), the language is set to English (United States).
