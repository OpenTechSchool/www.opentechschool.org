title: Contribute to Learning Materials
---

Similar to the process of [posting new blog articles](/handbooks/blog-posts.html), we also host most of our [learning materials](/material.html) as gh-pages and use the usual Github-Tools to manage them: Wikis, Issues, Forks and Pull-Requests. But as every material is unique in its way, they usually provide a Readme.md in the main directory to guide you through the process of setting it up and how to contribute if the process deviates far from what is described here.

## On Site: Issue tracking
While you are coaching and your material goes through the highest of all tests - learners approval - you might notice some clinches, bugs or mistakes. Share them with your fellow coaches and discuss them when you have a minute and then quickly add them as actionable issues to the repository. Maybe even someone already volunteered to fix them, assign them then.

## Translation: submit via Pull-Requests
When you want to create a localisation of the material, we recommend creating a fork and work on it separately in your own repository for a while. As such a task might be bigger it makes sense to invite some other contributors to help you with that. Once you are done, please submit your translation as via Pull-Request into the main repository.
