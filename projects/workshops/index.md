The classic and all time favorite, the coding workshops. With a strong focus on friendly and welcoming environment, these self-learning, peer-driven workshops try to get people together and get into or better at coding. While the introduction workshops often take place on weekends, a lot smaller workshops also happen during the week. Though initially created for adults, many of these workshops can and are also run with a younger audience.

Workshops take place where and when the local teams finds appropriate. They are normally announced and organised through the given meetup group. The OpenTechSchool runs workshops of all kinds and topics. Many of the needed learning materials can be found online at [learn.opentechschool.org](https://learn.opentechschool.org/).

If you are interested in starting a new workshop, please take a look at our [Handbook on how to start a Workshop](/handbooks/workshops/starting-a-workshop.html), our [Coaches Guidelines](https://opentechschool.github.com/slides/presentations/coaching/) and the [Schedule for Workshop organisers](/handbooks/workshops/organisers-schedule.html).
