## Email

We organise our work in teams: various groups of people take care of different tasks. Please feel free to email the one you think is most appropriate for your inquiry.

Our teams mailing lists are:

 * OpenTechSchool global: The [public discussion group](https://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/discuss.global) accessible and visible to everyone for discussing all topics related to OTS. If you want to connect with people involved with OTS in your city or start a discussion about a certain topic which does not yet have its [own coaching group](/handbooks/mailing-lists.html#coaches_lists), send an email here.

 * [Team beginners meetup](mailto:team.beginners-meetup@opentechschool.org) organises the beginner and learnermeetups. If you have an interesting proposal, want to talk about something or connect one of the organisers about anything, this is where your email should go.

 * [Team sponsors](mailto:team.sponsors@opentechschool.org) takes care of the sponsorship for events like meetups and workshops. If you are interested in sponsoring one of our events, either with money, food or by offering a venue, let them know.

 * [Team content](mailto:team.content@opentechschool.org) also known as _Team Rocket_ is in charge of finding content for blog posts and copyediting. If you have a post you'd like to have published on the OTS blog or you are presenting OTS somewhere and want to have your materials reviewed, ask here.

 * [Team communications](mailto:team.communications@opentechschool.org) takes care of all online and offline OTS communication. Whether you have something you think OTS would like to tweet or facebook, or you are interested in having one of us speak at your event/conference, send your emails here.

 * [Team blueprint](mailto:team.blueprint@opentechschool.org) is in charge of the [handbooks]({{site.baseurl}}/handbooks/). If you find any mistakes, have feedback or want more information about a specific part, send your email here.

 * [Team tech](mailto:team.tech@opentechschool.org) organises the tech parts of OTS, such as the GitHub accounts, email adresses, domains, etc. If you need help setting up a mailing list or any of the aforementioned points, send your email here.
