## About

We're the first OpenTechSchool team outside of Germany! We are developing
a network of coworking spaces, startups, schools, and institutions to
organize our events, and are currently collaborating with the KTH
(Royal Institute of Technology) and KKH (Royal Institute of Art) to
create a university-powered hacker space in town.
