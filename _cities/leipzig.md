## About

Leipzig's reputation as 'the new Berlin' - it's thriving creative scene, affordable living and the active art- and club scene led to the nickname 'Hypezig'. Residents might not love this name, but the continous growth of the city and it's tech and startup community can't be dismissed. New possibilities open up in this space and are waiting for you to get involved. Through OpenTechSchool we would like to offer a beginner friendly and safe learning environment for everyone interested in getting started with programming.

We organize events to learn, collaborate and meet other learners. If you interested in tech, would like to try out programming or if you need help with your project, feel free to join our OpenTechSchool Events. Everyone who agrees with our [Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/code-of-conduct/) is invited to participate.
