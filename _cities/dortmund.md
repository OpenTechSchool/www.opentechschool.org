## About OpenTechSchool

OpenTechSchool e.V. is a non-profit organisation. OpenTechSchool Dortmund is a regional chapter. We love to encourage people to learn more about open technologies as well as start coding in general. This is an important part of our mission. We teach non-programmers, the basics of programming. Usually during workshop weekends. You can find all our planned workshops over the Meetup Group.

## About chapter Dortmund

As passionate computer science students we've started an OpenTechSchool chapter in the heart of the Ruhrpott. A metropolitan area with a fast developing Start-Up and IT Scene. 

Therefore we established a local community over the last year. Now we have ***monthly Learner's Meetups*** with two technical talks and a lot of fun. Come join us using the Meetup Website.

## About you?

You haven't started programming yet but you are very curious about coding? Well, you can learn about modern technologies during one of our beginner's workshops. Learn how to start programming in a friendly and supportive environment. For free!

You are a passionate coder eversince? That is awesome because we are, too! The workshops we offer are non-profit and community driven. This is why ***we need you*** to support newcomer learners. 

***Return something*** to the opensource movement, by supporting a new generation of opensource learners. Everything while meeting new and interesting people at the coolest scene-locations of our area. Contributing never made that much fun!

## Donations
