## About

Bristol: home of Banksy, Aardman, Concorde and great cider. And, after London, the UK's leading hub of digital enterprise. In 2013, we set up [CodeHub](https://www.codehub.org.uk) to create a space for developers to learn from one another. Seeing that it was quite similar to OpenTechSchool, we decided to join the global network.

There are many technical groups and meetups in Bristol. Check out Bristol WebFolk's [calendar of tech events](https://bristolwebfolk.github.io/calendar/) and possibly Bristol's longest-running series of web tech events, [Skillswap](https://bristolskillswap.org/).
